            <h1>Dysfunctional's Tech, Bombs, Guns, and War</h1>
            <p>Project Update:That's right were back, after forming Dysfunctional Entertainment we went to start a new pack that would a spiritual successor to "Hexangle's Tech, Bombs, Guns, and War" but could not translate the popularity over to the new pack so instead were coming back and merging them to create "Dysfunctional's Tech, Bombs, Guns, and War." We are also working on a 1.19+ pack but I won't speak too much about that right now. Both the 1.12 and 1.19+ packs will be updated and maintained at the same time but as for older versions of the pack they will be archived.
            <br><br>1.12.2 Information:Dysfunctional's Tech, Bombs, Guns, and War is designed from the ground up with multiplayer and performance in mind. We have included all the essentials mods for a great war pack Flan's Mod, Nuclear Tech Mod, ICBM Classic, and Techguns. Even with these great mods an equivalent tech mods are needed Mekanism, Refined Storage, Immersive Engineering, Industrial Forgoing, Advanced Generators, and PneumaticCraft are included to mass produce your "Peace Keeping Tools". Along with these mods there are many more to round out the experience and ensure the death and destruction of any adversary you may have.</p>
