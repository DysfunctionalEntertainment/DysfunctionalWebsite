            <h1>Dysfunctional's Tech, Bombs, Guns, and War</h1>
            <p>1.19.2 Information: Opposed to our 1.12.2 pack I took a very different approach to tech mod choice focusing on multi block structures like Immersive Engineering and Create instead of Mekanism or The Thermal Series. As for guns Mr.Crayfishes gun mod plus addons were chosen, unfortunately HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod is not updated to recent versions of Minecraft so aurilisdev's tech mod collection was chosen. Personal maintenance is also a large part of this pack so you will need to eat a diverse diet to stay healthy along with per section damage depending on where you are hit similar to Tarkov's health system. As for future plans I would like to build out a diverse quest tree seamlessly blending every mod together to give a clear direction for single player and figure out a way to fill the world with more challenges making weaponry more of necessary step for progression. We designed this for multiplayer more so than single player but in the future I aim to remedy that.
            <br><br>1.12.2 Information: The classic war pack experience with everything you love Flan's Mod, HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod, ICBM Classic, and Techguns, Mekanism, Refined Storage, Immersive Engineering, Industrial Forgoing, Advanced Generators, Pneumatic Craft, and many more. This is not a "Light Pack" and it's not meant to be it can be unfair, overpowered, buggy, and broken but can always guarantee a good time. If you're playing with friends or by yourself it has everything you need to decimate anything or anyone in your way. A performance mod like Optifine is highly recommended and a PC with 16GB of ram or more but it should work fine with out it.
            <br><br>Calcium's Edit And Public Server: An edit of our 1.12.2 pack designed for PAIN AND FUN, balancing and cohesion are thrown out in turn for a chaotic mess of destruction.</p>

            <h1>Dysfunctional's Magic and Menagerie</h1>
            <p>Magic is cool, magic is great, and exploring is even cooler. Combining structures, magic, and dragons (Who invited them, not even I know!), our coding monkeys at Dysfunctional Ent. have been hard at work making this modpack. In this modpack, you'll need to gather several different resources of varying complexity to gain ultimate power! From the fabled flux sponge capable of cleaning reality, to the mana pool of guilt, to several other items that need twice the resources of the last to make! Now, go, explore, and discover what these items are, and how they work!</p>
